   <h1>Almond Tart</h1> 
    <img src="../images/almond-tart.webp" width="200">
   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>his flourless cake from Galicia, Spain, is traditionally made with separated eggs and flavored with citrus and/or cinnamon. We liked it made more simply, with whole eggs and just a small measure of vanilla and almond extracts. A sprinkling of chopped almonds and coarse raw sugar on top of the batter gives the surface a chewy-crisp crust that contrasts wonderfully with the dense, plush crumb of the cake’s interior. Crème fraîche and fresh berries are perfect accompaniments.<p>The apple and almond go so well together too.</p> <p>Make it a day ahead then just reheat it when you are ready to serve.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <li>4 eggs</li>
     <li>250g sugar</li>
